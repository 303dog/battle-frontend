Digital Resume for JS/Rails Mod

Welcome to my "Digital Portfolio"

It is my hope that this program will be able to display some of my accomplishments in regards to programming and using specific programming languages.

After forking and cloning "https://github.com/303dog/digital_resume.git" into your local environment you will need to CD into $/digital_resume-backend and start the rails server by typing "$/rails s" in your terminal. Next, you will need to open the file 'index.html' for the live preview which differs depending on your set-up. Note: it may be necessary to run '$/rails db:migrate' followed by '$/rails db:seed' to sync and load data the first time you run this program.

On the frontend you will be able to see how I used Javascript to manipulate the DOM and render some past projects I built while attending Flatiron School. Under each project title are some details of each program including programming languages used and a link to the github repository. Please take some time to look over the examples of work I have provided.

After you have had a moment to examine the code and explore the site, please feel free to leave your feedback on any given examples. Your feedback is appreciated as I have only just recently started programming/coding and look forward to becoming a more accomplished programmer/coder!

Fork and clone: "https://github.com/303dog/digital_resume.git"

$cd digital_resume/

digital_resume/ $cd digital_resume-backend/

$bundle install

$rails db:migrate (optional)

$rails db:seed (optional)

$rails s (this starts the server)

Don't forget to start the HTML live preview. (ususally accomplished by right clicking the 'index.html' file in the frontend directory.)
